## Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues this process until the list is sorted.

## Insertion sort
Insertion sort is a simple algorithm that iterates through an array, comparing each element with the ones before it and placing it in the correct position. It builds a sorted section gradually and is efficient for small arrays or partially sorted data
